    <Intro page="/ projects" title="here's some stuff I worked on">
        Here's a few projects I feel good enough about to show off.
        I also worked on a few other things like modding, mapping and datamining in Source Engine games,
        as well as some Discord bots.
        Additionally, I have experience with languages that aren't listed below, such as PHP and various SQL versions.
        I'm also no stranger to running a server and selfhost a few services.

    <Project
        title="Astral Search"
        date="still cooking..."
        tags="C#, Dalamud, FFXIV"
        description="A spotlight-like search plugin for FFXIV I made to learn C#, loosely based on another plugin called Wotsit. Among the changes are a new UI and backend changes to add more customizability, like disabling individual commands."

    <Project
        title="buh.moe (current)"
        date="October 2025"
        tags="HTML, CSS, JS, Astro"
        link="https://buh.moe/"
        description="I change the design of my website pretty often, I think this is the 3rd version this year? This design adds a few dynamic elements like my Discord status, uses more Astro features and keeps some cool things from my previous Deadlock theme. I also switched from vercel (ewwww) to cloudflare for hosting"

    <Project
        title="amemoia.nekoweb.org"
        date="January 2024"
        tags="HTML, CSS, JS"
        link="https://amemoia.nekoweb.org/"
        description="A website modeled after Needy Streamer Overload's UI, trying to be as faithful to the game as possible. I mostly consider this abandoned as it was a pain to update. Still available to view on my Nekoweb."

    <Project
        title="Various Discord bots"
        date="2018-2021"
        tags="Python, discord.py"
        description="I made a bunch of bots over the years. They had a wide range of modules so you could take a few cogs and package it up as a more specialized bot, like for role color selection or creating a list of server emotes. The Python skills from this pretty much carried me through school which in turn got me into my university of choice."
