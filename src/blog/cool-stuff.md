Inspired by NotNite's [oh yeah that's good](https://notnite.com/blog/oytg)

This is basically a list of things I find neat. Might update it in the future
<div class="coolstuff-list">

# Games
- Deadlock : in-dev MOBA third person shooter by Valve. despite hating MOBAs i fell in love with this game, if we're moots feel free to hit me up for an invite if you need one!
- Yakuza / Like a Dragon : absolutely batshit insane game series that somehow has a very moving story spanning decades, too much side content, great combat and is cheap to get into
- Judgment + Lost Judgment : probably the best work from RGG Studio (Yakuza/LaD studio) to date
- Final Fantasy XIV : really amazing MMORPG that I've sunk too many hours into
- Hi-Fi RUSH : rhythm-based 3d platformer hack and slash, peppermint and korsica should kiss
- Grant Theft Auto V : I played the singleplayer way too many times, it's been with me pretty much my entire life
- Death Stranding : my favorite work from Kojima. i cried
- Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds : not a Sonic Riders remake but for now this will do. surprisingly engaging

## Indie
- UNDERTALE + DELTARUNE : no triple-A game will ever compare to the effect these two had on me
- ENA: Dream BBQ : it's insane how much art went into this game, absolute masterpiece
- Cruelty Squad : When this beat drops I'm going to fucking kill myself.
- Euro Truck Simulator 2 : pretty relaxing, getting drunk and playing this is pretty fun
- A Hat in Time : the cutest 3D platformer. i love it so much
- ULTRAKILL : boomer shooter so hard that it wraps around and becomes crack in FPS form
- Terraria : i have 150 hours in this game and never beat the wall of flesh
- The Stanley Parable : i don't even know how to begin describing this. the narrator is a gem
- Helltaker + Awaria : great characters, great artstyle, great music, poland, ghost yuri (awaria)
- Balatro : Wheel of Fortune
- Neon White : mid story aside this is a very fun FPS speedrunning game
- 100% Orange Juice : very fun and cheap board game to play with friends
- WEBFISHING : very fun way to chill and hang out with friends
- Buckshot Roulette : russian roulette with a shotgun, super fun in multiplayer
- Xonotic : cool free arena shooter i used to play against bots when i was bored (arena shooters are so fun i wish they weren't so dead)

## Oldies
- Sonic Riders (2006) : to me, this is the best racing game ever made. nothing scratches the same itch
- Crash Nitro Kart (2003) : I didnt play the original Crash Team Racing, but this is also really good!
- Spider-Man 2 (2004) : pizza delivery simulator
- Cars (2006 game) : surprisingly good game, takes place after the events of the movie

# Movies & Shows
- Cars (2006 movie) : the movie of my childhood
- SpiderVerse : if you can spare like 100gb i highly recommend watching these in high bitrate
- Bocchi The Rock! : i liked this so much that i named my ffxiv character after it
- JoJo's Bizarre Adventure : this turned me really cringe but still i love jojo
- One Punch Man : 100 push ups. 100 situps. 100 squats. and a 10km run. every. single. day.
