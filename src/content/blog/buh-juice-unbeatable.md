hi im writing (most of) this while watching the game awards. i just finished [unbeatable](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/) at 1am and would like to spill some brain juice about it, this is going to be a very emotional review of sorts?

*maybe disorganized collection of thoughts is a better way to put it*

## ok what is it

if you dont know about [unbeatable](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/), its a flashy rhythm game with a full narrative as well as an "arcade mode" with all the usual rhythm game bells and whistles. it's recently had its full release after a delay.

i first learned about this game when the [\[white label\]](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290490/UNBEATABLE_white_label/) side story came out (or its first chapter anyway). i cant believe this game has been with me for like four years now, honestly with how my life has went it kind of feels like its been with me for a decade. wild.

some of the songs that came out with [\[white label\]](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290490/UNBEATABLE_white_label/) have helped me get over multiple breakups, as well as some arguably worse friend breakups somewhat recently (shoutout to [waiting](https://youtu.be/Ux3HGFb2HTg) and [forever now](https://youtu.be/oCv6mGvQQUs)). i think this is why the game means so much to me.

the gameplay is fun too and the dialogue is great. i love how characters talk over each other or interrupt/interject and the dialogue bubbles are set up in a creative way to reflect that... but most importantly im just *in love* with the music. part of me feels like this is a game for music nerds, and i dont know anything about music, but i still had a lot of fun!

another very neat surprise was learning that this game is voice acted... i went into this game fully expecting it to have no voiced dialogue, and it turns out that not only is it voiced but the voice actors did a pretty good job!

i especially liked treble, who is voiced by [noodle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj74rJ9Lgl3WTngq675wxKg), a youtuber i like to watch *(took me a minute to realize why he sounds so familiar)*

## it's flawed but i love it so much

sadly, unbeatables story mode is very buggy and messy, to a point where it affected my enjoyment of it a bit. i was willing to look past the bugs, which paid off a lot! i cried for a full hour after finishing the game which is insane for someone like me thats very out of touch with her emotions.

i hope that if you do give the game a shot, you play through it fully and dont give up on it due to the various issues. i encountered one crash, one softlock and i think i accidentally skipped a story sequence because a sidequest took over. despite all this i still consider unbeatable my game of the year.

most of my criticisms apply to **episode 4** of the story mode, which felt like the most undercooked part of the game. its rather bad even from a storytelling standpoint *(especially on the pacing front)*, and i feel like a lot more care was put into episodes 5 and 6. i had **ZERO** issues during those and they were also very good story-wise. 

i dont have too much to say about arcade mode, it's basically the proper rhythm game part of unbeatable, with unlockable songs and customization options. i think this is where the bulk of the post-launch content will go to and if you get the breakout edition, which i highly recommend, you get a bunch of collab songs including ones from lena raine and jamie paige. honestly though, the best songs in this game are all the original ones, it's genuinely banger after banger after banger to a point where it feels like i bought an album with a game bundled with it

## in other words

i dont want this blog post to be too long, so to summarize i think that [unbeatable](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/) is an **S-** or **A+** tier game, it has a lot of kinks that need to be ironed out but it was so good that i am willing to look past all of that. it's oozing with passion, the art is amazing, the music is amazing and i can't wait to see more from d-cell. please give it a shot!! i legit cannot recommend it enough.

(dcell please let me play the old version of waiting... it means so much to me)
